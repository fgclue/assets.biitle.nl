# How to make a basic Hello, World! Program in C++

C++ is a very good programming language, it is a superset of C.

So first you’re going to include iostream.

`#include <iostream>`

Now use int main() to say that that is what is going to happen in the start

`int main()

{

      // Your code should be here

}`

Then use Standard Caracther Input (std::cout) to say Hello, World!

`int main()

{

     std::cout << "Hello, World!";

}`

Now lets use return to return the output

`int main()

{

     std::cout << "Hello, World!";

int main()

{

     std::cout << "Hello, World!";

}

int main()

{

     std::cout << "Hello, World!";

     return 0;

}`

# Making it fancy

Now we are going to import unistd.h so we can use sleep()

#include <unistd.h>

Now we are going to put sleep(time) in the middle of std::cout and return 0;

int main()

{

     std::cout << "Hello, World!";

     sleep(20)

     return 0;

}

Now lets compile it using g++.

First, open a terminal and run g++ code.cpp

`> g++ code.cpp`

Now you will get a file called a.exe (if your on windows), now run that file

`> .\a.exe`

Output:

`Hello, World!`

And even if you don’t run that file from the terminal, it will still make a window.
